{"id":"daily-chow-5ti","title":"Copy/Export solved meal plan","description":"Add a 'Copy to clipboard' button that produces a clean text summary of the solved meal plan: ingredient names + gram quantities + key macros. Optionally include micronutrient coverage summary. Bridges the gap between planning and doing — without this, users must manually transcribe solver output. Could also support a print-friendly view. Button should appear in the results panel near the totals section.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"sean.b.johnsen@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T10:01:41.677453-05:00","created_by":"Sean Johnsen","updated_at":"2026-02-15T10:01:41.677453-05:00"}

Add to Major Minerals tier with DRI/UL values (UL: 2300mg, AI: 1500mg). Include in solver optimization, UL enforcement, and frontend micronutrient coverage bars. Low effort, high payoff — fills a genuine nutritional blind spot using data already available in the USDA database.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"sean.b.johnsen@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T10:00:51.193219-05:00","created_by":"Sean Johnsen","updated_at":"2026-02-15T10:00:51.193219-05:00"}
{"id":"daily-chow-cgd","title":"Add LLM-scored commonness ranking to food database","description":"Add a 'commonness' score (1-5) to each food in foods.json, generated by Claude Haiku at build time, to weight ingredient search results toward everyday foods.\n\n## Problem\n- 4,840 foods in DB, ~455 (10%) are dried/dehydrated/powder/canned variants\n- Search sorts alphabetically + gap score with no normalness weighting\n- 'Dried Egg' appears above 'Egg (Grade A, large)' when searching 'egg'\n\n## Implementation\n1. **Build script** (scripts/build_food_db.py): Add generate_commonness() function parallel to generate_names(). Batch 50 foods per Haiku call. Prompt: rate 1-5 how commonly a typical grocery shopper would buy each food (5=everyday staple, 3=normal but less frequent, 1=specialty/obscure). Cache in commonness_cache.json (resumable, same pattern as name_cache.json).\n2. **Data** (foods.json): Add 'commonness' integer field (1-5) per food entry.\n3. **Frontend** (AddIngredientModal.svelte): Update search sort to factor in commonness. Hard tier for default/no-query listing (commonness desc \u003e gap score desc). Soft blend when user is actively searching (nameStartsWithQuery \u003e commonness desc \u003e gap score desc).\n\n## Cost\n- ~97 Haiku calls (one-time, cached)\n- One integer field per food — negligible size increase","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"sean.b.johnsen@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T10:36:01.017759-05:00","created_by":"Sean Johnsen","updated_at":"2026-02-15T17:15:00.673085-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T17:15:00.673085-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented commonness ranking, excluded spices/flour, fixed solver overflow"}
{"id":"daily-chow-qqk","title":"Swap ingredient: suggest replacements ranked by commonness and nutritional similarity","description":"Add a 'swap' action to each ingredient row that opens a modal suggesting replacement foods. Replacements should be ranked by how well they fill a similar nutritional profile to the food being swapped, weighted by commonness score. For example, swapping out salmon should suggest other high-omega/protein foods like chicken breast or tuna, preferring everyday staples (high commonness) over obscure items. The modal should show the nutritional delta (what you gain/lose) for each suggestion.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"sean.b.johnsen@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T10:45:40.895296-05:00","created_by":"Sean Johnsen","updated_at":"2026-02-15T10:45:40.895296-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"daily-chow-qqk","depends_on_id":"daily-chow-cgd","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-15T10:46:09.650252-05:00","created_by":"Sean Johnsen"}]}
